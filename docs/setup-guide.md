## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic understanding of GitHub Issues and Projects
- Client requirements gathered (see Phase 1)

## Quick Start Checklist

### Before You Begin
- [ ] Client discovery call completed
- [ ] Repository access confirmed
- [ ] Timeline and budget approved
- [ ] Success criteria defined

### Phase-by-Phase Completion
- [ ] Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Issue #1)
- [ ] Phase 2: Repository Setup (Issue #2)
- [ ] Phase 3: Projects Configuration (Issue #3)
- [ ] Phase 4: Content Creation (Issue #4)
- [ ] Phase 5: Advanced Features (Issue #5)
- [ ] Phase 6: Documentation (Issue #6)

## Detailed Implementation

Each phase is documented as a GitHub issue with:
- Clear objectives and acceptance criteria
- Step-by-step instructions
- Required deliverables
- Time estimates
- Success metrics

## Tips for Success

1. **Follow the Order** - Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Document Everything** - Use issue comments to track progress
3. **Get Client Feedback** - Validate approach at each major milestone
4. **Test Thoroughly** - Ensure all features work before handoff
5. **Plan for Maintenance** - Set up processes for ongoing updates

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping discovery phase
- Not getting client buy-in on structure
- Over-engineering the solution
- Insufficient documentation
- No maintenance plan
